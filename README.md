# SpotLLM
Repository to store the ML model which predicts whether the text is generated by the LLM or the human itself.

Currently,
I have tried two approach, one is based on the dataset which contains around 4.4L rows (having text and respective label)
1) With pre-trained DistilBertClassifier
2) Zero-shot classifier from huggingface:
    -> facebook/bart-large-mnli (Using pipeline)
    -> MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli
